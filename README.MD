# Quantum Voice AI 🌌

Pseudo quantum entanglement communication using Local AI on mobile devices.

## Features

- 🎤 **Voice Recognition** - Real-time speech to text
- 🌌 **Quantum Simulation** - Entangled state synchronization  
- 📱 **Mobile Optimized** - Works on phones like Redmi 12
- 🤖 **Local AI** - Runs completely in browser
- 🔗 **P2P Communication** - Direct phone-to-phone connection

## How to Test

1. **Open on Two Phones**: Deploy this page and open on both devices
2. **Connect**: Click "Connect Phones" and enter the other phone's code
3. **Speak**: Click "START VOICE" and speak - watch messages sync
4. **Observe**: Watch quantum connection strength grow

## Technology

- **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer communication
- **Web Speech API** for voice recognition  
- **Local AI** for intelligent responses
- **Quantum State Simulation** for entanglement
